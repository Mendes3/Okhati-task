# Awesome Login form is a simple website containing login, register and welcome page.
# login page contains a login form where username and password are required. After you click login button, you are directed to welcome page.
# Welcome page consists a logout option at the right bottom corner. When you logout, you are directed to login page again.
# If you are not a member already, then you can register by visiting the register page. It requires you to fill all the necessary credentials to register. After you click the register button, you are directed to login page again.
# Only these three functionalities are working right now but we can create pages and redirect to other pages easily. I am only done front end part only, where my main aim was to create simple login, register and welcome pages. 
# The backend portion can also be done if required. 
# React is used here.
# The website is hosted in netlify.
